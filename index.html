                    Keep the area around your AC unit clear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important things you can do to keep your air conditioner running smoothly is to keep the area around the unit clear of debris and obstructions. This includes things like leaves, dirt, and even lawn furniture. All of these items can block airflow and make it harder for your AC to do its job. In addition, be sure to keep the area around your <a href="https://www.loyalhomeservices.com/san-antonio-air-conditioning/ac-repair/">AC unit</a> free of any flammable materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important thing you can do to keep your air conditioner running smoothly is to have it serviced by a professional regularly. This will ensure that the unit is clean and free of any potential problems. Servicing also helps to extend the life of your AC unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, make sure that you are using the proper size air conditioner for the space you have available. An air conditioner that is too small will not be able to cool your home effectively, while an air conditioner that is too large will use more energy than necessary, resulting in higher utility bills.

                            Another key to keeping your air conditioner running smoothly is to change the filter regularly. Most experts recommend changing it at least once a month, but if you live in an area with a lot of pollen or dust, you may need to change it more often. A dirty filter will make your AC work harder than it needs to and can even lead to a breakdown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The condenser and evaporator coils are what remove the heat from your home, so they must be able to do their job efficiently. You can clean them yourself with a brush and some cleaner explicitly made for coils, or you can hire a professional to do it for you.

                    The coils in your AC unit are responsible for transferring heat. If they become dirty, it will make it harder for your AC to do its job and can even lead to a breakdown. To clean the coils, simply remove them and rinse them with a garden hose. You can also use a coil cleaning solution, but be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

                            One of the best ways to keep your air conditioner running smoothly is to get routine <a href="https://www.loyalhomeservices.com/san-antonio-air-conditioning/ac-service/">maintenance</a> done by a professional. This should be done at least once a year, but twice a year is even better. During maintenance, the technician will clean the coils, change the filter, and inspect the unit for any potential problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you live in an area with a lot of pollen or other airborne allergens, you may need to change your filter more often. You can check the condition of your filter by holding it up to a light. If you can see through it, it’s time for a new one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you first turn on your air conditioner for the season, be sure to give it a few hours to cool down your home before turning it off again. This will help prolong its lifespan.

                    If you have any questions about how to keep your air conditioner running smoothly, or if you think there may be a problem with your unit, be sure to contact a professional right away. The sooner a problem is detected and repaired, the better chance you have of avoiding serious damage to your unit.

                    Upgrade your thermostat
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you have an older thermostat, it might be time to upgrade to a newer model. Newer thermostats are more accurate and can help your AC run more efficiently. You can save money on your energy bill and have greater control over the temperature in your home by upgrading to a newer thermostat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many different types of thermostats available on the market, so it’s important to do your research to find the one that will work best for your home and your needs. Some factors you might want to consider when choosing a new thermostat include:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
                    <li>
                        Ease of use: You want a model that is easy to operate and program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accuracy: Look for a model that is highly accurate so you can trust the temperature readings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Energy efficiency: Choose a model that can help your AC run more efficiently, saving you money on your energy bill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compatibility: Make sure the thermostat you choose is compatible with your AC unit.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Once you’ve considered all of these factors, you can narrow down your choices and select the best thermostat for your home.

                <p>
                    In addition to using your air conditioner, you can also use fans to help keep your home cool. ceiling fans are a great option because they circulate the air without cooling the room too much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a window fan, you can point it towards the outside to help draw in cooler air from the outside. Just be sure to open your windows first so that the fan has something to work with! You can also use floor fans to help circulate the air in your home and keep things cool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way to stay cool is to make sure that your home is well-insulated. This will help to keep the cool air inside and the hot air out. You can check the insulation in your walls and ceilings to see if it <a href="https://www.loyalhomeservices.com/san-antonio-air-conditioning/ac-replacement/">needs to be replaced</a> or added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, you can also use shade to your advantage during the hotter months. If you have trees or shrubs around your home,

                <br>
                <p>
                    Another simple way to keep your home cool is to close the blinds or curtains during the day. This will help block out the sun’s heat and make it easier for your AC to keep the temperature down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also try opening windows at night to let in cooler air. Just be sure to close them during the day so the heat doesn’t come in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, make sure you’re not generating unnecessary heat in your home. Avoid using the oven or stove during the day, and unplug any electronics that generate heat when they’re not in use. Following these tips can keep your home cool and comfortable all summer long.
